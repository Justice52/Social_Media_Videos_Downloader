# Social_Media_Videos_Downloader

# Overview
This project is a Python-based web application that allows users to download videos from various social media platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. It provides a simple and intuitive interface where users can input the URL of the video they want to download and click on a download button to initiate the download process.
